# Lesson 2

## Accessing repositories

Like mentioned in the last lesson, you can maintain both local and remote Git repositories. In this lesson we are going to discuss one way to access remote repositories that exist on the Nowacek Lab organization.

A quick PSA: if you want to use another repository that is not in this organization as a starting point for your work, you most likely will **NOT** want to follow these instructions. Instead, you will probably want to [**fork**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository instead.

### How to access a respository

For this group, we will mostly be interested in accessing remote repositories that exist on the Nowacek Lab organization that we want to use/adapt for our project. 

The general process one should follow is **Clone in GitHub** ...  **Open in GitHub Desktop** ... **Specify location for local repository to be stored** ... **Now you have copies of all the files locally that you can edit and use!** 

Let's practice a real-life example!

1. Open the [PracticeRepo](https://github.com/NowacekLab/PracticeRepo) in a new tab
2. In upper right, click green "Code" and in the drop down click "Open in GitHub Desktop"
3. Your browser shoudl redirect you to GitHub Desktop but you might have to allow it because #chromethings
4. In GitHub Desktop you will now see an open window that asks you for some info... all you need to give it is the Local Path. This is where the files and the local repository will live on your computer. 
5. Click clone!
6. Check the Local Path you gave it and see if the files are there...
