## Accessing and creating local and remote repositories

Like mentioned in the last lesson, you can maintain both local and remote Git repositories. In this lesson, we are going to discuss  a couple of ways to access existing repositories, a couple of ways to create repositories, and how to use GitHub Desktop to make sure that as you build or work in respositories those changes are reflected both locally and remotely. This last part is important, especially when collaborating on code, to make sure that everyone can see your changes when you've added to or improved code and to make sure that when  others make changes, you are working with the most up-to-date code. 

### Ways to access a respository

For this group, we will mostly be interested in accessing remote repositories that exist on the Nowacek Lab organization that we want to use/adapt for our project. 

1. Clone in GitHub
2. Open in GitHub Desktop
3. Specify location for local repository to be stored
4. Now you have copies of all the files locally that you can edit and use! 

### Ways to create a respository 

We also may have code that we want to contribute to the repository for others to use OR we may want to work on a new project collboratively.  There are a few ways to start a new repo, each of which may be more useful depending on the way your project may already exist locally.

**Option #1: Starting on GitHub (remote first, then local)**

1. Click "New"
2. Give your repository a name, description, and initialize with a README
3. Follow the instructions in the "Ways to access a repository" to add this repository to your GitHub Desktop and create a local repository
4. Add files through the normal File Explorer and edit files through any IDE/text editor

**Option #2: Starting in GitHub Desktop (remote and local kinda simultaneously)**

1. Click "File," "New Repository"
2. Give your repository a name, description, set the path for the local repository, and initialize with a README
3. Publish the repo to GitHub 

**Option #3: Starting in terminal, then GitHub Desktop (local then remote)**
