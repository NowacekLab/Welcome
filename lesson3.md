# Lesson 3

## Making and pushing changes

Now that you've cloned the repository, you are going to want to work with the files in that repo. 

**A big heads up, before you make ANY changes or add any files you first need to get out of the master branch. If you forget this there are ways to fix it, but it's best just to train yourself to change branches first!**

### Start a new branch

1. In GitHub Desktop find the "Current Branch" drop down on the top menu bar
2. Click on it and click "New Branch". Create a new branch, maybe call it "yournames_branch"
3. Publish your branch to GitHub by clicking "Publish branch"
4. Now you have a new branch with copies of all of the files in the `master` branch. 
### Make some changes in a new branch (using a text editor, aka the more common way)

5. In GitHub Desktop (confirm that your Current Branch is the branch that you just made) you can now edit these files, add more files to the folder, add new folders, etc. This may be done in any text editor or your File Explorer (Atom, Notepad, Matlab, RStudio, VS Code, etc)
6. Make a change in the "file_you_want_to_access.txt' or add a new file and save your changes
7. In GitHub Desktop you should now see the contents of your repo and the changes you have made to files

### Push these changes to the new branch on GitHub
8. Now you want to commit these changes to your local repo. Give a descriptive commit message in the bottom left of the screen in GitHUb Desktop near your profile image. 
9. Click "Commit"
10. Now you want to push these changes to your branch on the remote GitHub repository. Click "Push Origin."
11. You should be able to see the changes that you just made reflected in the files in your branch on the GitHub website

### Making some changes in your new branch on the GitHub website
12. On the GitHub website go to your branch in the repository by using the button on the top left to select the branch
13. Click on one of the text files and on the right click the pencil to "Edit this file".
14. Make a change and then write a commit message and commit your changes
15. Now you need to get these changes locally. In GitHub Desktop, you should be in the correct repo and your branch and click "Fetch from origin"
16. A box will pop up that says "Pull origin," click it
17. If you now open the file you edited locally you should see these changes!
