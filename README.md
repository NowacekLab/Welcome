# Welcome
This repository will help you to get started with the Nowacek Lab GitHub organization. It contains information on how to make use of existing repos, add repos, and contribute to projects.

## What is a repository? (adapted from the GitHub documentation)
Right now, we’re in a GitHub repository within the Nowacek Lab organization called "Welcome". A repository is like a folder or storage space for your project. If you go to the [home page of this organization](https://github.com/NowacekLab), you can see what other repo's exist in this organization which look at lot more like a typical repo. Your project's repository contains all its files such as code, documentation, images, and more. It also tracks every change that you—or your collaborators—make to each file, so you can always go back to previous versions of your project if you make any mistakes.

You can own repositories individually (on your own GitHub account), or you can share ownership of repositories with other people in an organization (like the Nowacek Lab). 

You can restrict who has access to a repository by mkaing a repository public or private. You'll have this option when you first make a repository and can change it at any time in the settings tab. If you're unsure, it's probably best to just make it private. You can always make it public later.

### README files
Every repository should have a README file to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it. README.md files are typically written in Markdown which is what the ".md" stands for. Your README file will be the first thing a person sees when they look at your repo.README files typically include information on:

* What the project does
* Why the project is useful
* How users can get started with the project
* Where users can get help with your project
* Who maintains and contributes to the project

There's a bunch of info out there about how to make a good README but [here's one place to start](https://www.makeareadme.com/). [Here's a good cheat sheet for Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) so you can make nice looking README's.

### Editing repos
When you make any change to any file in your project (and save it), you’re making a commit. If you fix a typo, update a filename, or edit your code, you can add it to GitHub as a commit. Your commits represent your project’s entire history—and they’re all saved in your project’s repository.

With each commit, you have the opportunity to write a commit message (**do it!**), a short, meaningful (**the more descriptive the better!**) comment describing the change you’re making to a file. So you always know exactly what changed, no matter when you return to a commit. For the most part when you make a commit you'll want to commit to the `master` branch. The alternative is to "Create a **new branch** for this commit and start a pull request," which you'll only want to use when you make changes on your own 'branch' of the repo and bascially want to offer those changes to the `master` branch to consider which they can later choose to accpet or not.

### Making a new repo
When you start a new project, you'll probably want to create a new repository for it on GitHub. 

Let's say you want to start a project to look at the distribution of diving patterns of pilot whales throughout the course of a day beacuse you hypothesize that pilot whales might concentrate long dives during the day and spend more of the night time at the surface under the protection of darkness. Because this proejct is going to be a collaboration with people in the Nowacek Lab and you want to make the data, code, and results available to others in the lab you decide to make your project repo on with the Nowacek Lab organization.

1. On the organization [homepage](https://github.com/NowacekLab) click "New"

2. Give your repository a name, a description, and initialize it with a README

3. Add some info to the README file

You're probably going to need a few things to answer this question, namely **data** that gives you the dive profiles of pilot whales throughout the day, **documents** where you might have your .docx or .pptx files where you're writing your manuscript, **code** where you have your code to analyze the data, and **results** where you are saving the outputs of your analyses.
