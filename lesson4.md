# Lesson 4

## Creating repositories

### Ways to create a repository 


**Option #1a: You have an idea for a new repo but no code! (from GitHub Website)**

1. Click "New" on Nowacek Lab Github website
2. Give your repository a name, description, and initialize with a README
3. Follow the instructions in the "Ways to access a repository" to add this repository to your GitHub Desktop and create a local repository
4. Add files through the normal File Explorer and edit files through any IDE/text editor

**Option #1b: You have an idea for a new repo but no code! (from GitHub Desktop)**

1. Click "File," "New Repository"
2. Give your repository a name, description, set the path for the local repository, and initialize with a README
3. Publish the repo to GitHub 

**Option #2: You already have code! (from Github Desktop)**
1. In GitHub Desktop, drop down "File" and on the top right you should see "Add local respository"
2. It will ask you for the local path of the folders that you want in this repo, so find your folder and select it
3. It should give you a warning that there is no repo here, click the "Create a new respository link"
4. and give you the option of initialzing with a README (you should).
5. Now "Publish repo to GitHub," and I think here you should be able to select organization
4. You should be able to see your files on the GitHub website now
