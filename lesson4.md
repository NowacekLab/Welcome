# Lesson 4

## Creating repositories

### Ways to create a repository 

We also may have code that we want to contribute to the repository for others to use OR we may want to work on a new project collaboratively.  There are a few ways to start a new repo, each of which may be more useful depending on the way your project may already exist locally.

**Option #1: Starting on GitHub (remote first, then local)**

1. Click "New"
2. Give your repository a name, description, and initialize with a README
3. Follow the instructions in the "Ways to access a repository" to add this repository to your GitHub Desktop and create a local repository
4. Add files through the normal File Explorer and edit files through any IDE/text editor

**Option #2: Starting in GitHub Desktop (remote and local kinda simultaneously)**

1. Click "File," "New Repository"
2. Give your repository a name, description, set the path for the local repository, and initialize with a README
3. Publish the repo to GitHub 

**Option #3: Starting in GitHub Desktop (local then remote)**
1. Drop down "Current repository" and on the top right you should see "Add." Drop that down and select "Create new repository"
2. It will ask you for a name, the local paath of the folders that you want in this repo, and give you the option of initialzing with a README (you should).
3. Now "Publish repo to GitHub," and I think here you should be able to select organization
4. You should be able to see your files on the GitHub website now
